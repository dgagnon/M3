known bugs:
	* task running at specific times ( crontabs, i.e. the heartbeat ) loose sync sometime and start running at different times
	* messages are not deleted from the rabbitmq queue, it needs to be reset once in a while ( reload )
	* if a widget is not on the default view for a user, trying to access it (info or graph) from another view will fail
	* SLA reporting is broken (bad field)
	* Clearing the UI messages in the frontend sometime doesnt work (key error in db)
	* R1soft sometimes will use all the disk space  / sometime hang (needs reboot) / sometime slow down the system
	* sometimes the info or graph window does not open. reloading the page and waiting a bit before trying again usually works.
	* If a check is rename or deleted, widgets, tasks and metadata are left behind with the old names and need to be manually deleted. This includes re-adding to userviews.
	* adding new checks is create a threshold recovery event
	* AWS power calculation script has not been updated when the breakers changed.



Needed updates / known limitations / Possible improvments:
	* Create a UserProfile automatically when creating a user
	* Complete the removal of the old metadata system
	* The groups are used for too many different things (views,permissions and notifications) and should be either prefixed or put into a different model
	* Deleting or renaming checks should also delete/rename the tasks, widgets, metadata
	* Sending specific check's errors to a group is not implemented yet.
	* The UI messages (the error ones) could probably be removed and errors shown as a panel at the bottom.
	* figure out how to handle login the treshold failures of the standby XDP pump ( maybe don't log a failure if the last one was also a failure )
	* The templates need to be refined and updated to use verbose name and notes where possible
	* Remove all public references and replace with eStruxture
	* Not much active monitoring on the db and proxy server
	* the software stack has pending updates (django, djcelery, probably others )
	* add another front-end tailored for a NOC ( show only alarms )
	* Need to create a maintenance task to prune the tables
	* convert the breaker quick add function to a cli task
	* document the cli tasks
	* Add language support for french
	* Bind to domain for auth
	* automate adding to the default view when adding a new check
	* Lots of unpolled data still, need to add the checks (and standardize accross the hosts where possible).
	* move the db off the server ( maybe put it with influx and have a worker local on that machine handling only the influx tasks ? )
	* look into adding tags to objects ( for rooms, dc, type ), using manual mappings in influx now for graphana
	* traps require having the host in the host file and only supports the messages from the liebert gear at the moment.


Equipment:
	* # 7306 MTRLPQQSQRGPD3 needs to have the LDMF configured (looks like it's 2 pole / 20 AMPS for a100)


Needed config (minimal):
	* NTP enabled ( sync to managed device)
	* SNMP v2c with a custom community for 172.31.39.254 or 10.168.118.248  depending on which network you are in
	* set snmp traps (all options) to the same IP you allowed previously
	* Setup smtp server and test it
	* Setup contact and location
